## About Me

**Hey, I'm Yash Pundhir**

- I'm 23 and I live in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. I'm currently learning **Full Stack Web Development** in `MERN` Stack.

---

## Project Description

- In this project I have built a **Product Homepage** from the scratch using core `HTML` & `CSS` and then later used `Media Queries` to redesign the page for **Different Screen Sizes**

- This project is all about the **Position of Different Components** wrt **Different Screen Sizes** and thus used `CSS Flexbox` to realign those components on **Different Screen Sizes** .

- Note that I have made it **Responsive** to **Different Screen Sizes**, so it will work on the Laptop Screens, Desktop Screens, Tablets as well as Mobile Phones.

## What I have Learnt in this Project

- Good Understanding of `Media Queries`:

  - how we can align the same components on **Left to Right manner on Larger Screens** and **Top to Bottom manner on Smaller Screens**.

- Proper Usage of `CSS Flexbox`:

  - how the `CSS Flexbox` can be used to **align different components on the Different Screen Sizes** and how the **position of these components realign itself when the Screen Size is Altered**.

- how to use the `drop-shadow` property of `CSS` to create a **shadow effect** with the shape similar to that of the **Image Component**.

- CSS Positions:

  - learnt about the **positioning** of different **objects and images**.

  - learnt about how to place **one image just above another image** and how to fulfill the same condition on **Different Screen Sizes**.

  - how to realign the same images for **Different Screen Sizes**.

## Time Taken to Finish the Project

> I have taken around **1.5 hours** to complete the webpage design for the **Laptop Screen** and then **2.5 hours** more to make it **Responsive For Different Screen Sizes**.

---

I'm definitely more confident now in using `CSS Flexbox` and `Media Queries` in my future projects.
